# AMD Xilinx Zynq based System-On-Chip modular Hardware plattform

This repository includes PCB-project files for a Xilinx Zynq Based Hardware Plattform that can implement various I/O-Solutions in the form of System-on-Modules that make it capable to easily swap between peripheral modules for various DSP-based applications.

I make no guarantees as to device funtionality. Please review the components carefully before production.
